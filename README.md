## Inspiration
Many people nowadays forget what it means to be happy. They remember the pains but not the smiles. This project was created for that purpose, to remember what can be forgotten. People giving thanks to you? We will preserve that.

Over time, the user (that is you) will accumulate notes—thank you cards, wedding cards, get well cards—any card in the app. These cards will help you remember that you did good and that you made a change in this beautiful world.

## Why Should I Use Grace?
1. **You want to give someone or many people a note, whether it be a thank you note or a celebratory one, there are many more!**

2. **You want a customizable note sending/receiving app for an expensive cost of $0.00.**

Grace allows you to befriend or follow users. Befriending ables you to send a note to that person and vice versa. Following a user does not prohibit you to send them a note, however it allows them to send you one. This is especially useful for social media accounts with large following. Not only that, it is useful for companies too!

### Caveats
- This app allows you to create a note only in the app. It will not expose an API for customers. This is because:
  1. We want our grace cards to be handled by a human and not just a robot. We want them to be as genuine as possible and so—API is out of the scope of the project.
  2. I am an unemployed developer looking for a job. This project was both a gift to the community and part of my portfolio. This means that expensive features such as an exposed API is a no-no-mojo.
